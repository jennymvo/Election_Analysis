# Election Audit

## Overview of Project

This project consists of analyzing election data for counties and candidates in understanding their total number of votes, percentage of voters, and overall candidate and county winners.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn how to use python to analyze election data from a CSV file. This project involves doing the following:

1. Reading the CSV file from a particular folder.
2. Initializing objects.
3. Creating dictionaries, lists and variables.
4. Creating for-loops for iterating through rows of the data.
5. Print to terminal and save election results into a new txt file.

## Election Audit Results

- Create a for-loop for finding the county vote count, and find the percetage of the votes for each county.
- Find the winning county by finding the county with the largest vote count
    - Print the results to the terminal and save results into the text file
    ![County Votes ]
- Retrieve the vote count and the percentage of candidate votes.
    - Print the results for each candidate and save the results to the text file.
